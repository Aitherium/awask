"""Classify decision cards into DECISIONS vs CONTEXT.

A DECISION is something the owner needs to actively choose or approve:
  - Has selectable options (the owner picks one)
  - Has a deadline (time-dependent)
  - Kind is 'credential' (blocked on secret input)
  - Kind is 'blocked' (unblocks the session, no options)

CONTEXT is information-only — logged so the owner can review but requires
no action and should not interrupt:
  - Kind is 'info' with no options
  - No options and no deadline
  - Status-only phrases like "background run in progress"

Context cards of kind=info are auto-closed after 24 hours by the grouping
sweep (awask.grouping G3, run on a schedule).
DECISION cards stay open until the owner acts or they are cancelled.
