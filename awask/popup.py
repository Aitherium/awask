"""The decision card as an actual window you can act on.

This replaces the toast, which failed for the reason toasts usually fail: it is a
passive, disposable strip that queues alongside mail and chat, it does not
interrupt, and clicking it does nothing. A notification that competes with
notification noise loses to notification noise.

So this is a **card, not an alert**. It states the ask, shows the measurements
behind it, and puts the options on screen AS BUTTONS — clicking one answers the
card, records the choice, and delivers it to the blocked session's steering
mailbox. The window is the control surface, not an advert for one somewhere else.

Deliberate behaviours:

* **No native title bar.** The window draws its own dark chrome. Tk inherits the
  OS frame, which on Windows is a bright title bar wrapped around a near-black
  card — the one bit of the surface we do not control was the loudest thing on
  screen. The frame is redrawn here (drag, pin, close, resize grip) rather than
  left to the platform, with `AITHER_DECISIONS_CHROME=native` as the escape
  hatch for a window manager that dislikes override-redirect windows.

* **Nothing is truncated.** The first version cut facts at 200 characters and
  option labels at 70, so the card routinely showed a sentence ending in `…`
  with the decisive clause on the wrong side of the ellipsis. A card exists to
  make an ask decidable; a truncated ask is not decidable. The body scrolls
  instead, and the window grows to the tallest it can be on this screen.

* **The owner can TYPE.** Buttons answer a closed question, and the owner's real
  answer is often "neither — do this instead". The reply box steers the raising
  session (see ``awask.steerback``) without closing the card, and text
  left in the box when an option is clicked rides along as the answer note.

* **It can reach the terminal.** The card names a session; the controls act on
  it — focus its window, open a terminal at its directory, or type into it. What
  each control can actually do is labelled BEFORE it is clicked
  (``awask.terminal``), never discovered by clicking a dead button.

* **Graded focus.** ``critical``/``high`` take focus, because that is the whole
  point of the tier. ``normal`` appears on top WITHOUT stealing focus, so a card
  raised while you are mid-sentence cannot eat the sentence — the keystroke-theft
  failure this project has already been bitten by.

* **Keyboard first.** ``1``–``9`` pick an option, ``Enter`` takes the
  recommendation (on a credential card it opens the card's masked field in the
  awdesk Inbox), ``Ctrl+Enter`` sends the reply box, ``Esc`` snoozes,
  ``Ctrl+←/→`` walks the queue. Every binding is suppressed while the caret is in
  the reply box, so typing "1. do the thing" cannot answer the card.

* **stdlib tkinter, never PyQt.** Same rule as ``secure-human-input``: the
  surface that unblocks a human must not be able to fail on a missing dependency.

* **It is a VIEW over the store.** The window never holds the only copy of
  anything. Close it without answering and the card is still open everywhere
  else; answer it here and every other surface sees the answer.
