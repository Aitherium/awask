"""Which Claude Code sessions are alive AND waiting — the beam's liveness rule.

A ``cc-waiting:<session>:<stamp>`` card is raised by the Claude Code Notification
hook (``awask_notification_card.py``) and withdrawn by a UserPromptSubmit hook —
i.e. only when the owner next types in THAT session. A session that ended while
waiting never types again, so its card stayed open forever: measured 2026-10-28,
eight of them, up to 13 days old, pinned above every real ask on every surface.

The rule, shared so the status line, the daemon, awdesk and the reconcile sweep
cannot disagree:

* a session is LIVE when its registry file names a pid that is still running;
* it is WAITING when it is live and its status is not ``busy`` (a working session
  is not waiting on the owner);
* ``None`` means "not measured" and callers must count the card anyway — an
  unknown must never hide an ask.

Registry: ``~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`` (Claude Code's own; ``sessionId``,
``pid``, ``status``, ``updatedAt``). Override the directory with
``AITHER_CLAUDE_SESSIONS_DIR`` for tests.

Known limit: pid reuse can keep one stale card counting until the session file is
cleaned up; the reconcile sweep (OPS-STALE) is the backstop, not this module.
